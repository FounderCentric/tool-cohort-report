The Cohort Report
==================

A simple, single-page view of each team in your cohort, focused on current challenges and obstacles of the founders, and particular actions the accelerator can take to actually accelerate them.

Have an informal conversation with each team, addressing:

Conversations - are they struggling to understand data, spinning wheels with sales or marketing content that doesn't resonate?  Do they need to have more customer conversations?

Metrics - are they in need of collecting data? Are they working on areas that provide leverage to growth? Do they have evidence of this?

Product - do they need help with aspects of their product?

Sales - do they need help with sales?

Intros - what introductions do they need? Customers? Industry? Certain domain experts?

Iteration Speed - are they getting market feedback frequently enough?  Are they allowing themselves to get stuck on certain areas? (Wheel-spinning kills startups in accelerators.)

Business Model Focus - what aspects of their business model currently have their focus?

Notes - keep these actionable - what can the accelerator and network do to help?
